This project is an interactive vector visualization tool where you can click to create colorful, moving lines on a Tkinter canvas. Adjust settings like animation speed, color transitions, and vector behavior by changing parameters at the top of the code. Customize it further by tweaking the color() function for new effects or adding new user interactions!
