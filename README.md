Key Features
Interactive Vector Creation: Click to create vectors that animate in real-time.
Dynamic Color Transitions: Lines shift color based on vector proximity and speed, creating an evolving gradient effect.
Adjustable Parameters: Easily modify vector behavior, lifespan, and display options for custom effects.
Customization Guide
This guide will help you adjust core behaviors, colors, and user interaction, making it easy to personalize the tool.

1. Tweak Animation and Vector Dynamics
Several parameters control vector behavior and display. Adjust them as needed; theyâ€™re defined at the top of the code for easy access:

dt: The time interval (in milliseconds) that controls how often the screen updates. Lowering this value will make the animation smoother but may increase CPU load.
dn: The number of new lines generated per second. This affects the density of lines on the canvas.
k: A multiplier for vector strength, which affects how strongly each vector interacts with others. Higher values amplify motion.
lifetime: The lifespan of each point in frames before it disappears, creating a trailing effect.
linecol: The initial RGB color of the lines. This base color will shift dynamically as vectors move.
2. Customize Color Transitions
The color() function maps vector distance to a hue scale, so colors change based on vector proximity. To modify these effects:

max in the color() function sets the maximum distance for color shifts. Lowering this value makes colors transition more dramatically over shorter distances.
Hue Calculation: The hue formula within color() determines the gradient based on distance. Adjusting it will produce different color schemes.
3. Modify User Interactions
You can customize interactions to make the tool respond differently:

Click Events: add_vector() captures left-clicks on the canvas to create or extend vectors. Modify this function to introduce new interactions, such as double-clicking to change colors or using right-clicks for different effects.
Key Bindings: Pressing e toggles vector visibility, which clears the view temporarily. You can add additional key-based actions using root.bind('<key>', function).
4. Adjust Canvas Size and Layout
Customize the canvas dimensions by modifying screen_width and screen_height. Smaller canvases increase vector density, while larger canvases spread out the interactions. This change affects overall layout and animation style.

5. Exploring Additional Customizations
Main Animation Loop (main()): This function refreshes the canvas, draws vectors, and manages the lifespan of each point. Experiment here to adjust drawing styles, change line thickness, add new shapes, or explore different movement patterns.
Random Line Placement: By default, new lines spawn randomly on the canvas each frame. You could modify this to control where new lines appear or introduce patterns, creating structured start points or specific line flows.
